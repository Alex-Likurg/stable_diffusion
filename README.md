## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prepare the Frontend

Make sure you have `index.html` and `index.css` in your local folder — they serve as the web interface.

### 2. Run the Backend

Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will connect to your MySQL database.

### 3. Set Up API Routing

Install and run:

```bash
node index.js
```

This handles the connection to Stable Diffusion and routes image requests.

### 4. Launch Client

Open `index.html` in your browser locally.  
Use the dialog box to enter a text prompt and generate an image.
